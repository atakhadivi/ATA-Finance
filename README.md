Here is a README.md template you can use to document your investing blog Django project:

# Investing Blog

This is the source code for my stock market investing blog built using Django. I'm using this project to document my investing journey as a beginner and share what I learn along the way.

## Project Goals

With this blog, I aim to:

- Share my research and analysis on stocks/funds I choose to invest in
- Track my portfolio returns over time
- Reflect on investment mistakes and what I could learn from them
- Take input from readers on what stocks they think I should analyze next

Ideally this can serve as a transparent case study for amateur investors looking to get into the stock market.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help set up the project on your local environment.

### Prerequisites

You will need:

- Python 3
- Django 3+
- Optionally a virtual environment tool like virtualenv

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/investing_blog.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure settings (database, etc)
4. Run database migrations
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Create admin account
   ```sh
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
6. Run development server
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The blog should now be running at **127.0.0.1:8000**!

## Current Features

For now basic Django blog functionality:

- Write blog posts w/ tagging and categories
- Comment and discuss posts
- Site admin/moderation

### Upcoming Features

Over time I plan to add:

- User portfolio tracking
- Stock analysis calculators
- Graphing time-series market data
- Predicting models
- Email newsletters
